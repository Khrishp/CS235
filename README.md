# CS235
Class Projects from CS235 Data Structures. Creation from scratch of many of the basic data types used in object oriented programming.

For all of you CS students, I hope that this helps. Each one of these structures was created from my own head and is not the best in
terms of documentation or optimization. Good luck regardless!
