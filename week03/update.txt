I have started work on implementing the queue, it look almost exactly like the stack
but with a little bit different stuff

------------------- Aiden ^
I got a lot of work done on the queue, well I say a lot only because I kept getting 
distracted while doing it haha. The functions should all be correctly implemented?
Test 1 passes but that is an easy one, as of right now test 2 does not pass, I may have
messed up on the resize function. I am going to take a break and come back to it later. I 
am pushing to get all my homework done before saturday so I can relax and watch conference.
